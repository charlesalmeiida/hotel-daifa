    "text1": "Hotel Daifa is a hotel development that was built at a time when Florianópolis Downtown was being consolidated not only as a seasonal tourist destination, but also as an important business and events destination, especially after the inauguration of the Events Center, one of Florianópolis' largest event venues, which is 800 meters from our hotel.",
    "text2": "With a privileged location in front of the South Bay and with a Mediterranean style that harks back to the founder's heritage, Hotel Daifa is one of the city's most traditional hotels. It preserves the cozy atmosphere of an guesthouse with the structure of a hotel, with only 25 fully-equipped units, most of which are rooms with views of the city's postcards, such as the South Bay and the Hercílio Luz Bridge. At Hotel Daifa, the family atmosphere and the best value for money have become our differentials, providing a comfortable, economical stay very close to the city's main tourist, event and business attractions",
